## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader mode with 1 way ONLY:

* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press and hold the button on the back plate before connecting the power cable (USB), you will see a flash driving popping up in your PC, just copy and paste .uf2 firmware file into it and it will auto eject and reflash the firmware accordingly.

## Layout Customization

* Pre-requisite: QMK Knowledge, refer to their [documentations](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools)
* If only modifying existing keys and macros, you only need to know basic programming language, Cpp, and how to compile the firmwares using QMK MSYS.

## Acoustic Considerations

* It will not have any hollow feel thanks to the thick chassis wall and stable tenting with stainless steel bolts
* Heavy Tactile may be too loud as any dampening measure beside o-ring mods that can dampen the sound is not available with this back plate.

## Bolts and Insert Nuts

* 16*M4 10mm countersunk for Back Plate Mounting with chassis, MCU holder mounting and sensor holder mounting with trackball holder.
* 8*M5 for Tenting (Length up to you, roughly measure it with your preference tenting angle)
* 2*M3 10mm Countersunk for mounting sensor cover
* 3*M3 10mm Button for mounting trackball's ball bearing

## Trackball Bearings

* 3*MR63 Ball Bearing

## Anti-Slip Pads

* Just buy some 1cm/10mm silicone pads from shopee or aliexpress
* 3D Printed Foots for attaching silicone pads are not in the repo (I drafted it and printed it whithin 5 mins, so i didnt save it)

## Matrix Connections (Direct Solder or with Switch Socket)

* If direct solder, hot-swap is not possible
* Switch socket used for this keyboard: Kailh MX Switch Socket, just search shopee.
* Some good soldering skills and good flux are required for both direct solder or switch socket.

*Any more information just dm me at @_dr_tay instagram. Dont email me.*
